# Pwelett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

Pewlett-Hackard is an ever-evolving large company. Our company is now looking towards the future, and preparing for everything that this entails.  This is an employee research provided for our HR analyst, whose task is to find the answers to the following questions: Who will be retiring in the next few years? And how many positions will Pewlett-Hackard need to fill?. With the use of SQL, we will utilize the data available for all several thousand employees; an upgrade will be generated for retirement packages as well as a list of all its eligible employees.

#### Outcomes

To visualize the relationship between data sources and the companyâ€™s anatomy we created the following ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to facilitate the analysis:

With this visualization we were able to create different points of focus throughout the dataset. Currently there is a rather large number of employees that are about to retire according to their age. We also found that among these employees, many hold senior titles across all departments as shown in the table below.

This is a valuable outcome, because with this information not only are we able to identify the number of retiring employees per title, but also employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 
A mentorship program can be extremely beneficial for the company. As its best employees move into retirement, their experience and work ethic can be transmitted to new hires, securing a smooth transition for the company looking ahead.

## Mentorship Program

With the Mentorship program in mind, we are providing our HR analyst with a list of all the candidates that qualify to be a part of it. As it is shown, the company will need a lot of head of departments to be replaced; this program will need to be developed through capacitations to the new hires, and thus needs to be implemented with enough time for all positions to be successfully trained. Further analysis can be done to calculate the costs that this implies to the company with the guarantee that all efforts were made to continue to build a solid workforce. 

All data created, and a list of all the employees with their titles are found within the "Data" Folder
